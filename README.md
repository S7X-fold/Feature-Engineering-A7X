Assignment: Feature Engineering using Avenged Sevenfold Songs Dataset

# Feature Engineering – Avenged Sevenfold Songs Dataset

This project applies feature engineering techniques to a music metadata dataset containing Avenged Sevenfold tracks.

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Handling missing values (median + most frequent imputation)
3. Encoding categorical features (album, song name)
4. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
5. Creating a target variable (Era classification)
6. Dimensionality reduction using PCA (5 components)
7. Feature selection using SelectKBest
8. Final dataset summary

## Ethical Considerations
Although this dataset has no sensitive personal attributes, popularity bias and metadata bias may influence outcomes.  
Fair preprocessing and thoughtful feature selection reduce ethical risks.
